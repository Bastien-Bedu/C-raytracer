# Raytracer

This project is a raytracer coded in C, using the CSFML framework (but only using windows related functions, and a function to draw a pixel).
This is a 1st year project, accomplished as a group project (4 members).
This project is a school project. Therefore all code had to comply to the school coding style. It does not reflect the coding style I (or any contributor) enjoy most.
It is the reason all built-in functions are recoded from scratch (eg. atoi, printf...)


## Install CSFML

CSFML v2.3 is needed to run this project. You can install it from https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/csfml/index-fr.php, or use 'build_csfml.sh' script (for ubuntu/debian only).
If you choose to download by yourself, you'll need to compile the library into a lib named 'libc_graph_prog.so'.
If you choose to use the provided script, be careful it might cause some issues if you use CSFML or SFML. Make sure to read and understand the script beforehand.


## Run program
run the program with the path to the selected scene as argument. If you want a more detailed description of the inputs (especially the csv file) there is an available manual with the command "man -l raytracer2.1.gz".


## Example scenes

Some example scenes are provided, as well as their matching pictures. It will save you the time/trouble to make them, compute them or even compile the project.
